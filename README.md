## **Agile Methodology**
**What is Agile ?**
<br>Agile is a development methodology adopted today in the software industry. Agile promotes teamwork, flexible procedures, and sle-organizing teams.
  
**How I Incorporated Agile Methodology During The Development Cycle**
<br>SCRUM is a subset of Agile, a framework for developing software. SCRUM takes advantage of different techniques to achieve goals in Agile. SCRUM promotes an     iterative model where the planning is performed on a very short term. The basic time working unit is the sprint. SCRUM teams always reason in sprints and their planning is limited to sprints.

<br>**Sprint 1 (May 5): Sprint Planning, Research and Design** - Researching about various face recognition libraries and SDKs that can be used to make a face recognition      website. After finalising the tools and softwares for building my project, I searched for tutorials and tried to learn to incorporate the technologies in my  project.

<br>**Sprint 2 (May 14): Website development and debugging** - Started the development process by taking help from YouTube tutorials. Built a web application using html, css and javascript for the first time. 

<br>**Sprint 3 (May 21): Integrating my project and making final changes** - I integrated my project to make it complete. Did few final changes to the website to make it more appealing.
